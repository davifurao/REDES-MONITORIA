I use wsl on my pc so the commands target UBUNTU

If you want to execute this archives, you need to have installed python3 in your PC. if you use Linux or WSL(I recommend), you do this commands: 

To prepare your PC you check if it is up to date:

```cl
sudo apt-get update
```

```cl
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
<br>
<br>

Now, you need to install a python3 in your system
```cl
sudo apt-get install python3
```

To execute the archive, you type(for example, the archive name is udpclient.py):

```cl
python3 udpclient.py
```
